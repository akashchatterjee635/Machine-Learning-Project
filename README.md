<h3>1. Email Spam Detector</h3>
<p>In this project I have made a prediction model to check whether a given email to any account is spam or not. The data sets which I used is there in the repository.</p>
<h3>2. Predicting whether an employee will leave from a company</h3>
<p>I have used an hr_data I have made a machine learning model that can predict whether an employee can leave his/her job or not </p>
<h3> Hyper Parameter tunning of an iris dataset </h3>
<p>The dataset is from sklearn library where we have taken 3 models to predict the type of iris. We have taken the best model from support vector machine, random forrest and logestic regression.</p>
