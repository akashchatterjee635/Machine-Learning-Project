# Machine-Learning-Project
<h3>1. Email Spam Detector</h3>
<p>In this project I have made a prediction model to check whether a given email to any account is spam or not. The data sets which I used is there in the repository.</p>
<h3>2. Predicting whether an employee will leave from a company</h3>
<p>I have used an hr_data I have made a machine learning model that can predict whether an employee can leave his/her job or not </p>
<h3>3. Hyper Parameter tunning of an iris dataset </h3>
<p>The dataset is from sklearn library where we have taken 3 models to predict the type of iris. We have taken the best model from support vector machine, random forrest and logistic regression.</p>
<h3>4. Churn prediction of telecom company and a bank using ANN</h3>
<p>In this project we used artificial neural network using tensorflow where I got pretty good accuracy of around 85%. I have also mentioned the classification report and a confusion matrix visualized through seaborn.</p>
<h3>5. Image Recognition using CNN on CIFAR10 dataset</h3>
<p>In this I have used CNN based model which gave me around 76% accuracy. I have shown the classification report and the confusion matrix using seaborn visualization.</p>
<h3>6. NLP model to find word vector using Gensim library on product review dataset</h3>
<p>In this model I made a word2vec to convert a word into its vector. We can compare words between them to find its similarity. This can be used in further NLP models.</p>
